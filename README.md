# Scripting

## Scripting is an essential part of roblox development since it is what powers the entire roblox ecosystem

## This guide aims to teach people on how to script in lua.

### Part I: Variable

Think of variables as a person that can hold 1 item

And that item can be anything you want

What your thinking of is a variable

Variables are made using a magic word

Its like saying "open sesame" to open a door.

In variables case, the magic word is "local"

After the magic word, there is the name of the variable

Think of it as the address of the persons home. There you can find the variable and what its holding

It will look something like this:

```lua
local variable_name

```

It is standardized to end a variable with a newline

When a variable creation does not have a equal sign " = " then its given an item called `nil`
